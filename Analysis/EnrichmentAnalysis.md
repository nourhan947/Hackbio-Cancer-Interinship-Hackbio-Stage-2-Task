Following the enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in glioblastoma, several key pathways emerged. These pathways highlight critical mechanisms involved in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. They include:

1. **Proteolysis. (GO:0006508)**

Proteolysis is an important biological process for cell homeostasis and function, in which proteins are broken down into smaller peptides or amino acids, usually through enzymatic activity. Dysregulation of proteolytic enzymes is a hallmark observed in glioblastoma cells. This dysregulation can support tumor microenvironment by interrupting and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), thus facilitating tumor invasion and progression. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) enzymes is a biomarker of ECM degradation in glioblastoma and is considered a potential therapeutic target (Quesnel et al., 2020).

2. **Glutathione derivative metabolic proc. (GO:1901685)**

Glutathione (GSH) plays a crucial role in many cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. GSH deficiency has been observed in aging and a wide range of pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, cystic fibrosis (CF), and several viral infections. Glutathione derivatives contribute to the redox potential of the cell, thereby maintaining redox homeostasis.

One example related to glioblastoma (GBM) is the role of GSH and its derivatives in redox regulation and drug resistance. In drug-resistant GBM cells, enhanced GSH levels and increased glutathione reductase (GSR) activity allow the cells to withstand oxidative stress and chemotherapy. This makes GSR a potential target for improving GBM treatment efficacy. Therefore, understanding GSH metabolism in GBM is crucial for developing strategies that could enhance the effectiveness of current therapies.

3. **Glutathione derivative biosynthetic proc.( GO:1901687)**

Glutathione (GSH) is a crucial antioxidant that plays significant roles in cellular processes, including detoxification and redox homeostasis. Its biosynthesis and relationship with glioblastoma (GBM) are critical areas of research, particularly due to the implications for cancer treatment and tumor biology. For example, the role of Glutathione in Glioblastoma is Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense: Glioblastoma cells often experience elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress. GSH acts as a primary antioxidant, helping to neutralize ROS and protect cells from damage. In glioblastoma, high GSH levels are associated with tumor survival and resistance to therapies. The biosynthesis of glutathione is a complex process that plays a vital role in cellular defense mechanisms. Its relationship with glioblastoma underscores the importance of GSH in tumor biology and presents opportunities for therapeutic intervention in overcoming drug resistance and enhancing treatment efficacy.
